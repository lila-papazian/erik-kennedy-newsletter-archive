Hey Lila,

If you ever have to design **data table on mobile devices** (websites or native apps), we‚Äôll cover the **3 best techniques** for doing so in this email. That's it. Feel free to archive if not applicable.

But first... have you *seen* this?

It‚Äôs a quantum computer. Yes, it *actually exists*. No, it doesn‚Äôt work very well‚Ä¶ yet.

(Unlike the computer you‚Äôre using now, quantum computers need to be hermetically sealed from the outside world. If so much as a stray atom or photon hits them wrong, their unworldly powers of computation are completely nullified‚Ä¶ so, uh, good luck to those engineering teams :grimacing:

‚ÄúErik‚Äù, you might be wondering, ‚ÄúWhat on *earth* are you talking about?‚Äù. Good question. I bring this up for 3 reasons:

1. I‚Äôm on a **ridiculous quest** to trade my UX/UI design services for part of a **decommissioned quantum processor** (if you know anyone who can help me in this quest, I‚Äôd appreciate the introduction) 
2. Quantum computing will be the subject of our example design today 
3. The picture ‚Äì and story behind it ‚Äì are *awesome*. Nuff said.

OK, now let‚Äôs look at some tables. In particular, one that‚Äôs a *bit* wide for mobile:

What are our options? :thinking:

3/ Hide the least important columns
===================================

Look, it‚Äôs pretty basic, but if some data is *truly extraneous*, we can just *not show* *it on mobile* :shrug:

![](https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/OoTzHlLThsqc4ryBvXZd55lHH98N_20MNtrNrzxW8KhClL6PaXLEVbxQ7ZmWxOg0MLfiVlQ6lYzFe4-POLactX5l174R3r5ShRJ-XEcBa9TqX9KYqzucya_uozbb3VxdnHW8YRpY1BwEOIo=s0-d-e1-ft#https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/gJxGcuzsv4KXrV4Q8BDmRk/htRM9isZWHWmoojDhdzuNv/email?auto=)‚Äã

Design = tradeoffs, *so*:

- :white_check_mark: Super cheap to implement
- :x: Doesn‚Äôt actually show all the data ‚Äì and therefore not widely practical
- :point_up_2: You could add a ‚ÄúShow All‚Äù button as a compromise (and then risk massive horizontal scrolling)

Let‚Äôs get more nuanced here.

2/ Label-Value Pairs
====================

Slightly more refined is to expand each **row** into a **full blown 2-col table.**

Thinking through this one:

- ‚úÖ Shows all data
- ‚úÖ Actually possible with [pure CSS](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/4zuq65w5k0heh52nx3kbx/p8heh9h9v2kqortq/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb2RlcGVuLmlvL3BpeGVsY2hhci9wZW4vck5hS0xN)‚Äã
- :x: Takes a TON of vertical space
- ‚òùÔ∏è If there are too many rows for each item, you could hide some with a ‚ÄúShow All‚Äù link

But my *favorite* option is‚Ä¶

1/ Recreate as mobile list
==========================

Your developer might not like it, but by far the most flexible option is to redesign the desktop table as a mobile list. Mobile lists are standard, flexible, and can even open up to their own modal/page to show more details.

![](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/_VOJSQZMMi2dqj8hp1PiW4Xoyk3KTU7eWcfk1sTbMrqFYSIjY_Kl59mHRn9ueKBppp99J1f7g3xfjCX8Qjtn5LQNdxbztELfQZeALteJVpKPzvZXotinpBNdec24KU37ueVzWkAag4QQ3zI=s0-d-e1-ft#https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/gJxGcuzsv4KXrV4Q8BDmRk/pBov887ovNDJeCDAmkRemU/email?auto=)‚Äã

The tradeoffs are pretty clear:

- ‚úÖ Flexible (you can have grouping/sorting/filtering/modals/etc. as needed)
- ‚úÖ Makes use of commonly-used design patterns
- :x: Requires more development effort (sometimes *way* more)

Overall, this is my favorite. Apologies to all the developers who I work with üòâ.

Anyhow, I think **these three patterns** are the major ones you‚Äôll use for almost every responsive table.

Did I miss anything? Reply, let me know; I read every response üòé.

PS. I‚Äôve got a rare **UX/UI client project slot** open in the next few months. I‚Äôm most interested in projects involving new tech with huge potential ‚Äì like quantum computing, alternative energy (especially fusion / nuclear / geothermal), medical, regenerative agriculture, etc. ‚Äì but open to anything awesome üòé

Know of someone looking for UX/UI design work in those (or similar) areas? Discount applies if I can use the project in curriculum. Would love a quick reply. Thanks! :v:


**Was this design article useful?** Please forward this email to anyone else you know who‚Äôd benefit from it. It only takes 5 seconds ‚Äì and I put hours into writing each one. Thanks! üòé
